##### Install for Cuba, Roda, Sinatra and others with a flat structure
```bash
owl-install flat
```

Please see the message of owl-install. You may need to manually add the following gems to the projects Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'opal', github: 'janbiedermann/opal', branch: 'es6_modules'
gem 'opal-webpack-loader', '~> 0.13.0' # use the most recent released version here
```

Then:
```bash
yarn install
bundle install
```
The installer produces a `app_loader.rb` which `require './owl_init'`. `app_loader.rb` is used by the compile server to correctly determine opal load
paths. It should be required by `config.ru`.
Opal ruby files should then go in the newly created `opal` directory. With the option -o the directory can be named differently, for example:
```bash
owl-install flat -o supersuper
```
A directory `supersuper` will be created, opal files should then go there and will be properly resolved by webpack.

Complete set of directories and files created by the installer for projects with a flat structure:
